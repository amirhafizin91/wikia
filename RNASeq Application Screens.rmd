## Custom Theme 

We currently using this tools from this site : http://playground.ideashs.com/themescolor/ (**ExtJS 3.0 Color Theme Changer, v0.3** by: Javier RincÃ³n, aka Syscobra) to create different custom color theme.

Here is the step how to use the tools :
First, go to http://playground.ideashs.com/themescolor/
Select the **Source Theme** ( Ext Blue Original Theme or Ext Human Theme)
![](1st.png)
Click to the menu -> **Change : Hue, Saturation and Lightness**
Play around with the Hue/Saturation/Lightness and view the theme in panel **Preview Image(not exact or slow)**
Press "**Preview Colors**". You will see a palette of colors to compare with the original from Ext.
After that, enter your prefer **Theme Name** and click "**Generate Theme**".

Then, click "**Examples Components View**" tab to view the new custom theme components.
Click "**xtheme-enter-theme-name-here...**" to download the theme in zip format.

After downloaded, extract the zip file, you will get a resources folder that contain two folders called "css" and "images". 
Copy the folder inside "images" into our framework under "/var/www/frame/framework/extjs/resources/images/" and copy the css file inside "css" into our framework under "/var/www/frame/framework/extjs/resources/css/".
Then, change the css link name/location in "framework.php" from old to new custom theme name/location.
View framework in browser or refresh the framework.
